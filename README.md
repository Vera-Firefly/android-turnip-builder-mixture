This is a bash script to build freedreno/turnip for android as a magisk module.

### Scheduled Releases
- Automated releases at 06:00 UTC on the 1st and 15th of each month.

### Notes;
- Root must be visible to target app/game.
- Not compatible with android SkiaVK due to lack of ```VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer``` extension.
- Tested with these apps/games listed [here](list.md).

### To Build Locally
- Obtain the script [turnip_builder.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilhan-athn7/freedreno_turnip-CI/main/turnip_builder.sh) on your linux environment. (visit the link and use ```CTRL + S``` keys)
- Execute script on linux terminal ```bash ./turnip_builder.sh```
